* [Stacks and Queues in C]()
* [Stack operations]()
* [Queue operations]()
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl]() and [betty-doc.pl]()
* You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the C standard library
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `monty.h`
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project
## More Info
### Data structures
Please use the following data structures for this project. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.

```
/**
 * struct stack_s - doubly linked list representation of a stack (or queue)
 * @n: integer
 * @prev: points to the previous element of the stack (or queue)
 * @next: points to the next element of the stack (or queue)
 *
 * Description: doubly linked list node structure
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO
 */
typedef struct stack_s
{
        int n;
        struct stack_s *prev;
        struct stack_s *next;
} stack_t;
```
```
/**
 * struct instruction_s - opcode and its function
 * @opcode: the opcode
 * @f: function to handle the opcode
 *
 * Description: opcode and its function
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO
 */
typedef struct instruction_s
{
        char *opcode;
        void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);
} instruction_t;
```
## Compilation & Output
* Your code will be compiled this way:
```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
```
* Any output must be printed on `stdout`
* Any error message must be printed on `stderr`
	* [Here is a link to a GitHub repository]() that could help you making sure your errors are printed on `stderr`
## The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
